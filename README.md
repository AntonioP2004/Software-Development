# Software-Development
Antonio Parrinello 

I am learning how to become a software developer at Southwest Tech in Cedar city, Utah.

I am taking Software Development because i have come to enjoy coding a lot through middle school to high school and now here.

This repository is to store my class projects while i have a USB stick as a backup just to be safe.

this is my old repo and i will not be updating this any further and this repo will be deleted when i finish my course.
