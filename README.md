# Software-Development
Antonio Parrinello 

I am learning how to become a software developer at Southwest Tech in Cedar city, Utah.

I am taking Softwar Development becouse i plan on going to a larger college to become a software engineer.

This repository is to store my class projects while i have a USB stick as a backup to be safe.
